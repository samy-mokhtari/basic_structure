# AutoPly backend — Project configuration
# Purpose:
# - Declare project metadata and dependencies.
# - Define dev tooling (tests, linting, typing) and enforce minimum test coverage.
# Notes:
# - Coverage enforcement is configured via pytest-cov (see pytest.ini_options or pytest.ini).
# - Tech choices (frameworks/libs) are documented elsewhere; this file is only configuration.
